# Scholarship Alert – Automation

This repository contains automation scripts (scrapers and AI pipelines)
that ingest scholarship data into the Scholarship Alert backend.

## How it works

- Scrapers collect scholarship information from trusted sources
- Data is normalized
- Data is sent to the backend ingestion API:
  POST /ingest/calls

## Backend API

https://scholarship-alert-backend.onrender.com
